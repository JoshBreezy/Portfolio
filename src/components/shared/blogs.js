        One thing I've been looking into lately has been server tech, and hosting. After a little experimentation with linux and pihole, I've decided to implement a virtual machine with linux (probably ubuntu server) for hosting.
        There is still alot to learn, and I'm not confident enough yet to take the security risks that I can only imagine come with hosting from your own machine. BUT! I want to blog about the process. So for now, I'll be
        writing blogs as react components that will be pushed to the github that hosts this page. Here's to turning that commit grid green!`
